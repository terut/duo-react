Comming Soon..

## Development

For help getting started with React Native, view our online
[documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

```sh
# Run emulator(AVD) from android sdk directory
$ $ANDROID_HOME/tools/emulator -avd Nexus_5X_API_23

# Start react-native packager server.(Optional)
# Sometime packager server don't run due to some problems like inotify settings and so on when you execute `react-native run-android`.
# That problems depends on your enviroment. So, the best way is that you run packager server by myself.
$ react-native start

# Build react-native app
$ react-native run-android
```
